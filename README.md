## Launch Instructions:
run "Round2.jar"

## Next Steps:
no pvp game play has been conducted so the next steps would be to test the game and adjust game values to ensure that both the champions are viable options. 
Afterwards, an online mode to allow for distant pvp. Next, more stages should be made and the number of players available at one time should be increased.
To increase the diversity of play more champions should be added as well. Finally, an AI to control one of the players for solo play would be great.
